# exixir_spells

Learn elixir (cowboy in particular) and mixing it with python as well as
typescript/angular

## python_backend

This branch is for me to play around calling python functions from elixir. This
is not the most efficient way to interact with a database with a phoenix
project.

In this branch you will find:

* Sqlalchemy database
* Testing database with docker
* Communicating with python functions from elixir
* Basic Phoenix setup (without ecto)
* API Created with Phoenix
